# WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Currently, only calculator application is completed, Notes is still a WIP. The plan is to create several standalone clone applications, and only then create the OS UI.

Checkout [Storybook](https://cloneos-storybook-iperzic.vercel.app/) for demo.
